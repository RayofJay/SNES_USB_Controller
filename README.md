# SNES_USB_Controller
Convert an Original SNES Controller to USB primarily to be used with PC emulators.

I bought a teensy 3.2 to convert a SNES controller I had, but all the information I found either was for the old teensy 2.0, didn't provide the arduino code, didn't use the V520B chip in the SNES controller, or left out too much detail.  The arduino code attached works with the teensy 3.2 board and wired as shown to the SNES controller board.

I'm omitting a lot of detail here because this detail is easily found elsewhere via google.  This posting is to demonstrate the procedure specifically on the teensy 3.2 and to provide the actual arduino code.
